# Boggle-Hueristic
The code within this repository was a project for CS 0445. The goal of the project was to create a heuristic that could perfectly solve a boggle board regardless of the letters on the board. The code can be run using the main program boggle.java with the dictionary followed by the board file as command line arguements. For any questions on the code, please feel free to reach out to me at cdd43@pitt.edu.
